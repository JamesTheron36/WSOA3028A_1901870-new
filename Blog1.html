<h2 class = "title">The Library of Babel: All Possible Information</h2>
<p class = "blog">The library proposed by Borge  in the library of Babel, poses the question to knowledgeable wizards such as myself: What knowledge is out there waiting for us to discover and what knowledge do we create for ourselves? If we were to break down all written knowledge into information, then theoretically every piece of human knowledge that could ever exist could be rendered into a library given enough memory. The sheer number of possible letter combinations can be thought of as a finite number.  The library of babel, becomes an archive of information that can be formed through arranging the 26 character alphabet in every possible word formation to form not only every book any person has ever written, but also every book anybody will ever write and every book that may never be written. All knowledge that has been conceived, will be conceived and perhaps knowledge that we cannot possibly perseive may find itself within a book in the library. All of this along with a whole lot of noise in the form of the character formations that mean nothing or perhaps they mean something to an alternative life form in another part of the galaxy.

<p class = "blog">With knowledge that is true also comes knowledge that is false. For example, the notion that magic does not exist is false knowledge posed to us by the non-believers, who claim that all magic is just science that is presented as mystical hoodoo. Perhaps the idea that all knowledge can be represented by mere words alone is misguided, as I am a firm believer that the universe is under no obligation to make sense to us is such a way that may be put forth in the form of words on a page. It is perhaps arrogant to suggest that all the answers can be represented by the finite number of words that form the English language. How can we begin to describe something that is infinite with something that is finite? Human language was constructed with a purpose of communicating more complicated concepts between beings. What if the necessary language required to explain the magical unknown is something more complex than that which we use in everyday life. A language which we would maybe consider alien.
