<h2 class = "title">Character Rationale</h2>
<p class = "blog">The Ron James character that runs this fancy website predates it’s very conception. The name Ron James has long been my username for many years on various forums and video games as my real name is James already. The full name, Ron James, comes from a fairly insignificant but recurring side character in my favourite animated show, Adventure Time. The character is particularly important to me, not only because we partially share the same name but the person who voices Ron James in the show is none other than one of my favourite comedians and philosophers: Duncan Trussel.  I have been a long time listener of the podcast content Trussel has been putting out over the years and his appearance on Adventure time is a result of his longtime friendship with the show’s creator Pendalton Ward. Trussel and Ward also collaborated to create another animated show which is very dear to my heart called the Midnight Gospel.

<p class = "blog">The character that runs this very blog site, is not only named after Ron James, but is also loosely based on him (as well as aspects of my own personality). Ron James in adventure time runs a magic potions store in Wizards city and was one of the founders of the secret society formed by other wizard main characters in the show. The potions which he deals allow wizards (or non-wizards) of all experiences to perform complex spells by just opening a bottle. This to me is comparable to the magic any user can conjure using the technology accessible to anyone who can afford. The thinking behind the Ron James character that I created was that he would refer to the modern day technological wonders as different schools of magic and sorceries. If you think about it, what is real life magic but the wondrous capabilities made possible by advancements in computer science? Most people cannot explain how information travels through the air and ends up displayed on the metal plate that is your smartphone. Hence the magical wonder of the world wide web and other branching technologies that allow users to plug into an all encompassing network of information and application.
