<h2 class = "title">The Medium is Ahead of the Message</h2>
<p class = "blog">In 1964 Marshal McLuhan claimed that it is not the messages that we communicate through the electronic or analogue platforms but the mediums themselves that drive the culture we experience day to day. McLuhan was able to observe this magical phenomenon when the mediums of his time were shifting from the printed word towards the early electronic mediums of radio and television. The level of cultural influence exhibited in the modern day through the plethora of mediums within the great medium of the world wide web is perhaps even greater than McLuahn would have predicted. Not only has the influence of technology grown, but the level of accessibility has progressed to a point where users can access all of humankind’s collective information using a device we carry in our pockets, and everyone’s got one. The technology has become an extension of our minds, as the digital world has become an ocean of collective thoughts and emotions. The best and worst parts of our make-up have been reinforced. Some log in to the various social platforms seeking knowledge and betterment while others just want an echo chamber to tell them they’re right. The online environment can easily be all things to all people.

<p class = "blog">The potential for various social and sharing mediums to rise to the surface is greater than it’s ever been with the presence of the internet. But the platforms that manage to establish themselves are the ones that tap into the minds of the people for better and for worse. The likes of twitter and facebook give people the ability to converse with one another from any part of the world. This, I feel, creates a whole new way for us to disagree and alienate as our differences have never been in the spotlight more than they are now. Human’s have never been very good at accepting each other’s differences and values but now it’s all out there for everybody to see. The political world has shifted more and more towards a cultural war and populism has been more potent than ever. This is evident as the 45th president of the United States was able to penetrate the minds of the people by utilizing and embracing these tools of communication. McLuhan’s idea of the medium being more influential than the message perhaps never being more potent than in this scenario. 
</p>

<p class = "blog">Perhaps the medium that exhibits McLuhan’s hypothesis best is that of online video sharing. The internet provides a portal to endless video content to indulge all of the senses. The average user not only has access to more content than they can watch, but they also have the necessary tools and power to create video content of their own and share it with the world. This creates the dynamic where content is created with respect to all the online culture that has come before it. The level of connectivity rewires the human brain to think in terms of the great library of information that has come before us. The very concept of a public forum where anyone can post their own video content plays a role in contributing to immortalising the evolution of culture in an everlasting archive. We may find ourselves a hundred years down the line, being able to look back at a past generation of people in high definition quality video and interface with how they talked, how they thought and understand the pressing issues of the time.
