<h2 class = "title">The Garden of Forking Paths: a multifaceted perspective of time</h2>
<p class = "blog">In Borges’s short story: The garden of forking paths, the reader follows the perplexions of Yu Tsun: a Chinese man who finds himself working as a German spy during the second world war. Throughout the course of the story Yu Tsun finds himself questioning how his interpretation and perspective on the concept of time informs the reality in which he finds himself and the decisions which he makes. For instance, someone who strongly believes in the idea of planning. The very concept of a plan assumes that one can have some sort of influence over future events. In the story, the concept of losing a battle before it has begun is mentioned. The question is, was the battle lost because the plan was inadequate? Perhaps if I had the information necessary, I could have devised a successful battle plan. Perhaps it all failed because I am incompetant and was not capable of coming up with a plan of decent enough quality to achieve success. The answer to that question depends on how one views the idea of time, can the future be influenced by me or not? If it can be influenced, to what extent do my decisions play a role in changing the future. 
</p>

<p class = "blog">The alternative version of this planned perspective is that one can only prepare for the future by living and absorbing one’s self in the present. Some even believe in the idea of an all knowing god, an all knowing celestial being who is fully aware of the future all together. If time is a path that you are walking down, god is looking down and seeing the path as whole. This idea potentially contradicts the concept of free will, as it suggests that reality is fixed. If somebody knows exactly what is going to happen, then the idea of variation is perhaps a myth. Borges explores this concept as potentially leading to a great evil. If someone is resigned to a very specific future, it leaves the potential for their decisions to be somewhat immoral if the future they foresee is one of great destruction and this is deemed to be necessary to survive. This is particularly relevant as the story is set during one the world wars. The world leaders, those good and bad, were perhaps somewhat resigned to the desolate reality of conflict and destruction and saw it necessary to participate in a barbaric fight for the purpose of power.

<p class = "blog">One’s perspective on how they view the past is also relevant. The extent to which one dwells on what has happened previously holds the potential to influence how they make decisions which affect the future. This creates the potential for never ending cycles as one may become fixated on past decisions. Our protagonist, Yu Tsun, comes to the realisation that reality only truly exists in the present. The past ceases to exist and the future does not exist yet. This points towards the idea that the only real importance is how one interfaces with the present. The past moulds us whether we consider it or not.

</p>

<p class = "blog">The overarching idea touched upon in the garden of forking paths is that time is a labyrinth. There are twists and turns in the road that are consequential and there are paths that merely converge to the same place. Some decisions are of great consequence and some just lead you to the same place as another option. Perhaps this points towards the idea of a multiverse where there exists a reality where each and every path in the garden of forking paths was taken. All possible futures exist in a spaghetti like formation. An abstract reality that is under no obligation to make sense to use mere mortals.
