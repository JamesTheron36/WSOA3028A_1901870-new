<h2 class = "title">The Promise and Peril of User Generated Content</h2>
<p class = "blog">In the modern digital age, users have access to a plethora of content that tickles all of the senses. The magic of video games that may be downloaded and played without any form of physical ownership involved. The many songs and videos that can be accessed on demand from the various content sharing platforms. A library of Alexandriaâ€™s worth of information that now falls at the fingertips of any user with access to a screen with an internet connection. It truly is the time to be alive as now users even have easy access to the learning materials necessary to creating their own digital magic. The ultimate connection has been made between all users with access around the globe through the various social platforms. With the help of the internet, I personally have progressed in wizardry school of video game development. Information that I would have had to have spent hours in an old school library searching for, in the yester age. This Is indeed the golden age of user created content.

<p class = "blog">But with great power to create comes great responsibility as there is always a darkness to contrast the light of a golden age of creativity. This darkness I feel particularly rears it ugly head in the form of misinformation in the great sea of information. As users gain the ability to create, they also gain the ability to destroy. The misuse of this powerful tool for the sake of political and financial gain still finds itself to be prevalent. Those who seek to control the narrative have employed the technique of drowning good information in misinformation with the purpose of leaving users confused as to what is real and what is fake. This freedom to create and express may also provide those with insidious intent, the freedom to use the power to control the narrative in order to serve the interests of the few.
