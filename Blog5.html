<h2 class = "title">Hypertext, navigation and structure</h2>
<p class = "blog">The concept of the hyperlink, the analogue predecessor of the hypertext, dates back long before the birth of the internet, in the great halls of academia. Those who wished to add their two cents worth of knowledge to the growing archives of printed information, would cite the works that contributed for readers to refer to further reading on the topics. In an age where you could not just tap on the citation and fly to the relevant reading material, a user would have to find a copy of the cited work and navigate to the specified pages if they desired to read further on the subject in question. The idea of a hyperlink being used to cite and acknowledge information served a variety of purposes. Users could branch off down a path of knowledge and potentially reinforce or dispute the information put before them. A citation would contextualise a piece of work as a branch in the ever growing web of collaborative ideas and knowledge.

<p class = "blog">In today’s technological era, where the sharing of information through the printed word is falling further and further behind us, the concept of hypertext has emerged as the spiritual successor to the old school citation methods. As is the programmable nature of the modern era, users are no more than one click away from being able to jump almost instantly to the reading material in question. Not only has this improved the ability to cite and acknowledge sources of information, but new networks of information arise from a single click. The titanic rise of the world wide web has seen the concept of hyperlinking move long beyond just those searching in the realm of academia. Hypertext allows the user to navigate to referenced web pages by merely clicking on a highlighted line of text. It creates a very necessary structure in navigating the extensive and complex web of pages that is the internet. These digitally connected times have seen the idea of hyperlinking, which was once only relevant in the context of reading academic works, become an important tool to those who indulge in all things online. There isn’t a single webpage out there that does not use some form of hyperlinking as all sites these days are composed with multiple pages.

<p class = "blog">Hyperlinking allows web pages to maintain a certain level of structure that us mere mortals can comprehend. Pages are presented to us in such a way that allows us to find ourselves going further and further down a rabbit hole. The best example is perhaps that of the hyperlinking beside a youtube video. The user is presented with a series of thumbnails and links pertaining to similar videos that the all powerful sorcerer (the YouTube algorithm) has recommended. The user cannot help but continue watching the associated videos which are no more than a single click away. Before you know it, the time of day has flown by but you have now accumulated the collective knowledge of many online videos that have been delivered to you via a thumbnail and a title that you clicked on. The powerful wizards that designed this system knew exactly what you desired to watch and provided the easy access to a world of content that you didn’t even know you needed.
